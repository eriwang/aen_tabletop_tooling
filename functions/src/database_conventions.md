# Database Conventions

## Collections

- Collections should start be in plural PascalCase (uppercase first letter)
- Subcollections should be avoided

## Documents

- Documents should always be ID'd by an autogenerated ID
- Document field names should be in camelCase (lowercase first letter)
- Dynamic map keys should be avoided
- Enum-like values should be represented by a string that matches up to an enum in the code
- Groups of stats should be contained in a map and keyed by the enum string
    - This is a sidestep of the document field names rule, these are keys of a map and not a "document field"
    - This is a sidestep of the dynamic map keys rule, enums should be all enumerated and not dynamic
